For all you newcomers who are rightfully frustrated with the hunter web mail blocking forwarding for "security reasons":
How to forward your emails from myhunter to gmail or whatever and seeing that such a feature was blocked for some ridiculous security reasons, here is how you can get around that.
=========== Copy Pasted from another post of mine ============
Don't forget you can also "forward" your email from outlook to gmail even though Cuny/Hunter specifically disabled that feature by going using pop3 and all that jazz.
Go to settings in gmail -> Accounts and Import -> Check mail from other accounts (using POP3):
Click "Add a POP3 mail account you own"
Username: Firstname.lastnameandsomedigits@myhunter.cuny.edu
Pop Server: Outlook.office365.com
Port :995
Check "Always use a secure connection (SSL) when retrieving mail" and "Leave a copy of retrieved message on the server."
I also recommend checking "Label incoming messages" so you can keep track what emails came from where. You can also send emails through the hunter email by using smtp but I haven't bothered with that since I have only heard of 1 professor being all "I only reply to emails from hunter webmail".
